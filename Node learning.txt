Node learning

Node uses a single thread for ALL requests that it handles. 
Therefore, if any one request from any one user is slow, it could block 
the whole machine. e.g. in example below, 
database query could bomb the whole machine:

	var result = database.query("SELECT * FROM hugetable");
	console.log("Hello World");

To avoid this problem, Node uses event-driven, asynch callbacks. What that means is that we pass Node a function to call (callback) when it finishes a heavy operation. 

Once main thread executes all statements, it enters the event loop, which has any callbacks that are returned from other processes that were spawned off.

Basically the principle is "don't do heavy shit on the main thread"

Objects in javascript are just dictionaries with string keys.
